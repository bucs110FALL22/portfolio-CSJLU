# Final Project Milestone #2

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 6). 

Let's decide on our Final project. Select the idea from Milestone 1 that seems the most interesting to you.

Each class is a model of some real world object. We often refer to data classes as the ***models*** in a GUI program. Your models represent your application data.

Given what you have learned about classes on Chapter 6, describe the ***interface only*** of 3 classes you think you might need for your project.

*For example*, if you want to create a space invaders type game, you would need a class to represent the ship, which could have an interface such as: 

* class ship
    * moveLeft()
    * moveRight()
    * shoot()

***

Come up with interfaces fot 3 possible classes you think you may need. Again, brainstorm a little. Nothing is *wrong*.

## Class Interface 1

class Player
  i. attributes:
    1. x
    2. y
    3. player image
    4. player speed
    
  ii. methods:
    1. jump()
    2. move_right()
    3. move_left()

## Class Interface 2

class Mob
  i. attributes:
    1. x
    2. y
    3. mob image
    4. mob speed

  ii. methods:
    1. move_right()
    2. move_left()
    3. deal_damage()

## Class Interface 3

class Door
  i. attributes:
    1. x
    2. y
    3. door image
    
  ii. methods:
    1. open()
    2. display_locked_message()
    3. display_unlocked_message()
